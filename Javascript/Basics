EVOLUTION : 

Internet got invented in 1991.

MOSAIC - First web browser created by Marc Andreessen and Eric Bina at university of Illinois.
1993 - Net Scope browser static.
1995 -  Brendan Eich came up with first draft of MOCHA/ LiveScript/ JavaScript 
(Full of bugs)

1996 - Microsoft came up with Internet Explorer (language JScript - reverse engineered JavaScript).
     - This made things difficult.

So NetScope went to ECMA -  Europeans Computers Manufacturers Association.
Then,
1997 - ECMA 262 was released.

There after JS has been the standard language to build browsers.
